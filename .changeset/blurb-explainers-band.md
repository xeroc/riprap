Added an explainers band to the unlisted blurb page (`#/blurb`), below the email: the founder's six short videos and talks as quoted tweets, two per row, ordered by what they explain — the mutual, the verdict layer, the court, the full mtnDAO demo-day pitch (YouTube talk embedded inline), then the making-of posts. The five native X videos are self-hosted mp4s embedded with their poster frames; the X glyph top-right of each card links to the source tweet. TweetCard in the kit gains optional `media.video` (controllable `<video>` in place of the poster `<img>`), `meta` (engagement stamp beside the date), and the href behavior changed: the X glyph is the permalink while the card stays an `<article>` so interactive media never nests in a link. Tweet bodies are verbatim quotes with permalink provenance in `content.ts`.
